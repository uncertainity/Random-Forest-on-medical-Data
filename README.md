# Random-Forest-on-medical-Data
This is an analysis on data pulled from a long study.
The primary objective was not prediction but interpretation.
The other main challenge was a imbalanced data set.
To deal with the imbalanced nature, simple upsampling was used after several other methods (like SMOTE)
The algorithm used was random forest (the model was purposefully not pruned since the goal was not prediction)
Shapley values were used to get a proper interpretation of importance of the variables.
